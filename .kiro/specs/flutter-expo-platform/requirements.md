# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FlutterExpo is a development framework that enables Flutter applications to serve as the single source of truth for both mobile and web platforms. The system translates running Flutter UI into native React + TypeScript HTML in real-time, providing SEO optimization and accessibility while maintaining Flutter as the primary development surface. Mobile applications continue to run the full Flutter runtime, while web versions are generated as native React applications that mirror UI, state, and text content with automatic translation capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Flutter_Runtime**: The primary Flutter application running on mobile devices that serves as the canonical source of UI and business logic
- **Translator_Service**: A backend service that receives UI AST from Flutter and converts it to React component specifications
- **UI_AST**: A structured JSON representation of the Flutter UI tree including components, props, state, and event bindings
- **React_Renderer**: The web client application that receives component specifications and renders them as native HTML/React components
- **WebSocket_Protocol**: The real-time communication channel between Flutter runtime, translator service, and web clients
- **Translation_API**: External service (Google Translate, Azure, etc.) used for automatic text localization
- **SSR_Engine**: Server-side rendering capability for generating SEO-friendly HTML snapshots

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to write my application once in Flutter and have it automatically generate a web version, so that I can maintain a single codebase while supporting both mobile and web platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Flutter application is instrumented with FlutterExpo wrappers, THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL emit a structured UI_AST representation of the current screen
2. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL remain the authoritative source for all UI state and business logic
3. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL continue to function as a standard Flutter mobile application without performance degradation
4. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL emit UI updates through the WebSocket_Protocol whenever the UI state changes
5. WHERE the Flutter application uses unsupported widgets, THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL provide graceful fallback representations in the UI_AST

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to interact with the Flutter application through a native web interface, so that I can access the application with full SEO benefits and accessibility compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React_Renderer receives a UI specification from the Translator_Service, THE React_Renderer SHALL render native HTML components that mirror the Flutter UI
2. WHEN a user interacts with web components, THE React_Renderer SHALL send event notifications through the WebSocket_Protocol to the Flutter_Runtime
3. THE React_Renderer SHALL provide semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes for accessibility compliance
4. THE React_Renderer SHALL support real-time UI updates without page refreshes
5. WHERE network connectivity is lost, THE React_Renderer SHALL display the last known UI state and queue user interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the translator service to handle real-time communication between Flutter and web clients, so that UI changes are synchronized across all platforms instantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Flutter_Runtime emits a UI_AST update, THE Translator_Service SHALL receive and process the update within 100 milliseconds
2. THE Translator_Service SHALL map Flutter widget types to corresponding React component specifications
3. THE Translator_Service SHALL maintain WebSocket connections with multiple web clients simultaneously
4. THE Translator_Service SHALL forward user interaction events from web clients to the Flutter_Runtime
5. WHERE translation is required, THE Translator_Service SHALL integrate with the Translation_API to localize text content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want text content to be automatically translated for different locales, so that the application can serve international users without manual translation work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI_AST contains text nodes with textId identifiers, THE Translator_Service SHALL extract text content for translation
2. THE Translator_Service SHALL cache translated content by textId, source language, and target language combination
3. THE Translator_Service SHALL batch translation requests to optimize API usage and performance
4. THE Translation_API SHALL be configurable to support Google Translate, Azure Translator, or local translation models
5. WHERE translation fails or is unavailable, THE Translator_Service SHALL fall back to the original text content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an SEO specialist, I want the web version to generate proper HTML for search engine crawling, so that the application content is discoverable and indexable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SSR_Engine SHALL generate static HTML snapshots of application screens for search engine crawlers
2. THE SSR_Engine SHALL include proper meta tags, canonical URLs, and structured data in generated HTML
3. WHEN a crawler requests a page, THE SSR_Engine SHALL serve pre-rendered HTML within 200 milliseconds
4. THE SSR_Engine SHALL support sitemap generation based on application routes defined in the Flutter_Runtime
5. THE SSR_Engine SHALL cache rendered HTML and invalidate cache when UI_AST changes for the corresponding route

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to instrument my existing Flutter widgets with minimal code changes, so that I can adopt FlutterExpo without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL provide wrapper widgets (TText, TButton, TContainer) that emit UI_AST while preserving original Flutter behavior
2. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL support automated code transformation tools to convert standard Flutter widgets to FlutterExpo wrappers
3. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing Flutter development workflows
4. THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL provide debugging tools to visualize emitted UI_AST structures
5. WHERE wrapper widgets are not used, THE Flutter_Runtime SHALL provide automated traversal of the widget tree to generate UI_AST

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the platform to handle high traffic loads and provide reliable performance, so that users experience consistent application behavior across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Translator_Service SHALL support horizontal scaling to handle multiple Flutter_Runtime instances
2. THE WebSocket_Protocol SHALL implement connection pooling and automatic reconnection for reliability
3. THE Translator_Service SHALL cache frequently accessed UI specifications and translations in memory
4. THE React_Renderer SHALL implement optimistic updates for immediate user feedback
5. WHERE system load is high, THE Translator_Service SHALL prioritize critical UI updates over non-essential background processing
